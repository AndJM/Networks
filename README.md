### 1 Degree distribution in networks

+ Project answers the question: are academic papers cited randomly (from within their original domain) or is there an underlying "hidden pattern"?
+ Analyzes the (in-)degree distribution of a citation network and compares it with those of networks generated by two known random processes
+ Determines a good model for the observed citation pattern
+ Includes basic analytic tools for network construction and examination of degree distribution
+ Produces three plots using matplotlib
+ Uses a data set consisting of 27000+ nodes [alg_phys-cite.txt](degree%20distribution/alg_phys-cite.txt)
+ [Example networks](degree%20distribution/example_graphs.txt)

### 2 Network resilience

+ Project implements BFS to compute the set of connected components of an undirected network
+ Determines size of a network's largest connected component
+ Computes the resilience of a network (a measure of its connectivity)
+ Computes an attack pattern (a particular sequence of nodes whose removal is used to compute resilience)
+ Produces three line plots
+ Uses a data set  consisting of 1300+ nodes [alg_rf7.txt](graph%20resilience/alg_rf7.txt)
